# CIFAR-ImageClassification_project_CNN
This is a classification problem with 10 classes(muti-label classification). We can take a view on this image for more comprehension of the dataset.

CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.

Kaggle is hosting a CIFAR-10 leaderboard for the machine learning community to use for fun and practice. You can see how your approach compares to the latest research methods on Rodrigo Benenson's

Submissions are evaluated on classification accuracy (the percent of labels that are predicted correctly).

Submission Format

For each image in the test set, predict a label for the given id. Your labels must match the official labels exactly {airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck}. Your submission should have a header.
